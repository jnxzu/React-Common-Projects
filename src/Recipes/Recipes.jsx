            In a blender, combine the cashews, ½ cup water, lemon juice, onion
            powder, garlic powder and ¼ teaspoon of sea salt. Blend until

            the coconut flakes along with the tamari, maple syrup and smoked
            paprika on the pan and toss gently to coat. Spread in a thin layer
            on the pan and bake until dark golden brown and slightly crispy,
            about 10 minutes. Increase the oven temperature to 400°F and line a
            baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the tofu cubes on the pan
            and toss with a drizzle of olive oil and generous pinches of salt.
            Bake for 15 to 17 minutes or until golden brown around the edges. In
            a serving bowl, assemble the salad with the romaine, cherry
            tomatoes, cucumber, zucchini, corn, avocado and tofu. Top with the
            coconut “bacon” and serve with the dressing on the side. Store any
            extra dressing in a sealed container in the fridge.

            <li>1 ½ tbsp. Worcestershire Sauce</li>
            <li>1 tsp. Liquid Smoke</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In a large bowl, add the chicken. Begin to add the seasonings to the
            chicken (salt, pepper, seasoned salt, smoked paprika, onion powder,
            garlic powder, chili powder, Italian seasoning, Thyme, oregano
            leaves, squeeze the lemon, Worcestershire Sauce, and liquid smoke.)
            Use tongs or cover hands with disposable gloves and toss chicken in
            seasonings. Cover with plastic wrap and place in refrigerator for,
            at least, 30 minutes. Prepare your grill as desired. However, place
            most of the charcoal more heavily on one side of the bottom of the
            grill. Proceed to start fire according to manufacturer instructions.
            Cover half of the grill with aluminum foil. Once it’s safe, place
            the grill on top of the coals. Place the wings, with tongs, on the
            coal-heavy side of the grill. Flip the chicken wings after 5 minutes
            on each side. Place the chicken on the aluminum foil side to finish
            cooking. Remove from heat once chicken reaches an internal
            temperature of 165. Remove from heat and cover with aluminum foil
            until ready to serve.

            <li>1 can refried black beans, warmed</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Preheat oven to 425F Slice the portobellos into ½ inch thick wedges
            and slice bell pepper in to ½ thick strips. If adding onion, cut
            into ½ inch thick rings or half moons. Place all on a sheet-pan
            lined sheet pan &amp; Mix marinade ingredients together in a small
            bowl. Brush both sides of mushrooms liberally with the marinade,
            then remaining red bell pepper and onion lightly. Sprinkle
            portobellos with salt. Roast 20 minutes or until portobellos are
            fork-tender. While this is roasting, heat the beans any prep any
            additional garnishes. Pickled onions and Vegan cilantro Crema both
            take about 10 minutes to make. Or simply use avocado slices. When
            ready to serve, warm the tortillas ( over a gas flame on the stove,
            or in a toaster oven) and spread generously with the refried black
            beans. Divide chipotle portobellos and peppers (and onions if
            used)among the tortillas. Top with Cilantro Crema, Poblano Salsa, or
            avocado, fresh cilantro and optional pickled onions.

            Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and base-line and grease a deep

            the top. Scatter the raspberries over, then dollop the remaining
            cake mixture on top and roughly spread – you might find this easier
            to do with your fingers. Scatter with flaked almonds and bake for 50
            mins until golden. Cool, remove from the tin and dust with icing
